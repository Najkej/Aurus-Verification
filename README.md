# AurusVerification
### Fast open-source Roblox-Discord connection system


### What is AurusVerification?
AurusVerification is an open-source system for easy verification of Roblox-Discord connections. It allows the creation of games with a whitelist and verified Discord names.

### Why AurusVerification?
Reasons to choose our bot:

- Open-Sourced: Our bot is fully open for other developers, enabling modifications to the code as needed.

- Security: Our bot does not collect any private information, such as IP addresses. We prioritize user privacy, storing only essential information in our database.

- Swift Verification: The verification process in our bot is quick and straightforward. To verify, nothing more than access to a Roblox account is required.

- Developer-Friendly: Understanding the diverse needs of developers using our bot, as developers ourselves, we are open to any proposals for new features.

### How to Set It Up?
Currently, our team does not provide mass hosting services for your Discord bot. You need to host your bot, MySQL database, and API with your developer team on any service. Our bot does not require much from the server it operates on, but remember to choose servers according to your needs! We can configure our bot on your server for a fee and enable its functionality. Please contact us for more details.
